                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of September and the beginning of October every year is the
                     most
                     worthwhile time to go to Northern Xinjiang to
                     see the scenery. The autumn wind is getting colder, and the snow-capped mountains, golden wooden
                     houses, and
                     the
                     white
                     birch forest in Hemu Village are turning into the clouds. The autumn colors of the small village
                     are
                     particularly
                     brilliant. The dreamy scenery of smoke and mist makes people feel like they are in another world,
                     like
                     a
                     beautiful
                     fairy
                     tale world.</p>

                  <p>The most rare beauty is the casual scenery on the road from Kanas to Hemu, without the
                     crowds.Stopping
                     to
                     take
                     photos was also the happiest thing we did along the wayðŸ“·<br>
                     In fact, compared to going to the Wuyang
                     Wuyang scenic spot, it was not as good as the natural and pleasant beauty of the sheep and mountain
                     scenery
                     along the
                     way.</p>

                  <p>Autumn is the best time to travel to Xinjiang. The leaves of the autumn grass trees turn golden
                     yellow, and
                     the
                     forests
                     are dyed in many colors, forming the most beautiful pastoral picture. When we arrived at the
                     viewing
                     platform,
                     we
                     dismounted and took photos. The beautiful scenery in front of us made us feel very good. This
                     snow-covered
                     Hemu
                     Village
                     is hidden in the northwest border and deep in the Altai Mountains of northern Xinjiang. It has
                     preserved the
                     original
                     natural environment and the original living customs of the Mongolian Tuva people for hundreds of
                     years.</p>
