               The end of September and the beginning of October every year is the
               most
               worthwhile time to go to Northern Xinjiang to
               see the scenery. The autumn wind is getting colder, and the snow-capped mountains, golden wooden
               houses, and
               the
               white
               birch forest in Hemu Village are turning into the clouds. The autumn colors of the small village
               are
               particularly
               brilliant. The dreamy scenery of smoke and mist makes people feel like they are in another world,
               like
               a
               beautiful
               fairy
               tale world.</p>

            <p>The most rare beauty is the casual scenery on the road from Kanas to Hemu, without the
               crowds.Stopping
               to
               take
               photos was also the happiest thing we did along the wayðŸ“·<br>
               In fact, compared to going to the Wuyang
               Wuyang scenic spot, it was not as good as the natural and pleasant beauty of the sheep and mountain
               scenery
               along the
               way.</p>

            <p>Autumn is the best time to travel to Xinjiang. The leaves of the autumn grass trees turn golden
               yellow, and
               the
               forests
               are dyed in many colors, forming the most beautiful pastoral picture. When we arrived at the
               viewing
               platform,
               we
               dismounted and took photos. The beautiful scenery in front of us made us feel very good. This
               snow-covered
               Hemu
               Village
               is hidden in the northwest border and deep in the Altai Mountains of northern Xinjiang. It has
               preserved the
               original
               natural environment and the original living customs of the Mongolian Tuva people for hundreds of
               years.</p>

            <p>Beautiful clouds encountered on the way back.I like to watch the clouds on a windy day.
               Blown by the wind, a cloud turned into a big crab, dancing its claws as if to show its power. After a
               while, the big crab turned into a big squid. It seemed to be staring at me as if it wanted to eat me. I
               was very scared.
               After a while, it spread out and turned into many marshmallows, covering the sky, making people drool at
               the sight. The
               white clouds not far away are like many stones, with different postures: some are like rabbits, some are
               like gems, and
               some are like ingots.</p>
